# Persuasive Car Sales Chatbot for Tata Motors (RAG)

---

## Introduction
This project involves the development of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot designed specifically for Tata Motors. The objective was to build a conversational agent that could not only provide accurate information to potential customers but also engage them persuasively in order to improve lead capture and conversion. The chatbot integrates a knowledge base consisting of brochures and FAQs with a fine-tuned language model to ensure that answers remain grounded in facts while maintaining a persuasive sales-oriented tone.

## Background
Conventional sales chatbots are limited in their ability to handle complex customer queries. They tend to either produce generic answers or hallucinate information, which undermines customer trust and reduces engagement. With the rise of large language models and vector databases, it is possible to design systems that combine factual retrieval with natural dialogue generation. This project applies these advances in the specific context of Tata Motors car sales, ensuring both factual accuracy and persuasive dialog aligned with sales objectives.

## Problem Statement
Car buyers often want to understand the detailed features of vehicles, compare models, and ask questions about financing, warranties, and competitive advantages. A major problem with existing systems is their inability to consistently provide correct and contextually relevant answers while maintaining a persuasive flow. The problem addressed here is the creation of a chatbot that can answer grounded in Tata’s official material while simultaneously persuading the customer to move closer to a purchase decision.

## Terminologies
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** Framework where an LLM retrieves knowledge chunks before generating an answer.  
- **FAISS:** Facebook AI Similarity Search, used for vector database indexing and retrieval.  
- **MiniLM:** A lightweight transformer for embedding text into dense vectors.  
- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation):** Efficient fine-tuning technique for large models.  
- **TinyLlama-1.1B:** A small open-source LLM used as the generative backbone.

## Dataset
The dataset comprised brochures, FAQs, and official product documents from Tata Motors. These documents were processed into smaller textual segments to enable semantic search. The information included specifications of cars, financing details, and after-sales service information. The dataset served as the authoritative knowledge base, ensuring that every response generated by the chatbot could be traced back to official Tata material.

## Data Cleaning & Imputation
The raw documents contained extraneous details such as headers, disclaimers, and formatting artefacts. These were cleaned to maintain consistency in the text corpus. Repeated entries across FAQs were removed, and in cases where certain details such as warranty information were missing from one document, they were imputed using verified entries from other official Tata sources. This ensured that the knowledge base was both consistent and complete.

## Methodology
The pipeline began with ingestion of the raw brochures and FAQs. These were chunked into text passages of manageable length and embedded using MiniLM. The embeddings and associated metadata were indexed in FAISS, enabling efficient retrieval at query time. For each user query, the retriever fetched the top relevant passages which were then combined with the query and fed to TinyLlama. This model had been fine-tuned using LoRA to align with persuasive sales dialogue. The generated response thus combined factual correctness with persuasive framing. To evaluate the chatbot, a large language model was used as a judge to score responses using a framework that comprised correctness/groundedness, completeness, relevance, tone/helpfulness, and persuasiveness.

## Model Architecture
The overall system architecture consisted of three layers. The first was the retrieval layer, which employed FAISS and MiniLM embeddings to extract relevant knowledge chunks. The second was the generation layer, where TinyLlama, fine-tuned with LoRA, produced the final text. The third was the persuasion layer, where the chatbot’s responses were evaluated and adjusted to align with principles of persuasive communication. This modular design allowed the system to remain grounded while adapting its tone to suit sales interactions.

## Results & Discussion
The chatbot demonstrated strong performance in maintaining factual accuracy and persuasiveness. Compared to a baseline FAQ bot, it led to higher user engagement and a reduction in cases where customers explicitly requested to speak with a human agent. Users interacted for longer sessions, and the system was able to handle detailed queries about cars in a manner that built trust and interest. The results showed that retrieval grounding reduced hallucinations, while the fine-tuned model successfully employed persuasive techniques aligned with Tata’s sales objectives. However, the system requires continuous updating of brochures and FAQs to remain current, and the persuasive framing must be carefully tuned to match evolving brand guidelines.

---

## Conclusion & Future Scope
The chatbot confirmed that combining retrieval grounding with persuasive fine-tuning is a promising approach for digital sales assistants. The conclusion is that such systems can bridge the gap between factual correctness and sales effectiveness in the automotive industry. For the future, the project can be extended by integrating real-time APIs for pricing and inventory, adding multilingual capabilities for wider Indian market reach. Additionally, expansion into after-sales service chatbots for maintenance and warranty queries represents a natural extension of this system’s capabilities.
